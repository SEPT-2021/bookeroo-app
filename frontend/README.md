# Bookeroo

Welcome to Bookeroo's frontend!
This README will help you get started working on this project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with the Typescript
template.

We use `yarn` as its faster, and easier to use. To install, do `npm install -g yarn` and then run `yarn` at the root of
this project to install the needed dependencies.

Our app is deployed on [bookeroo.surge.sh](http://bookeroo.surge.sh). Check it out!

### Linting and Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent coding styles and best practises within our codebase.\
Our code style is based off the popular airbnb ruleset.

You can run the linter as so: `yarn lint`

To fix any (simple) errors the linter finds, do `yarn lint --fix`.

## Other scripts:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
